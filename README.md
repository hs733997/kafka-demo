## Context

This project is a Java-based microservice built with Spring Boot and Gradle. It includes a Kafka consumer that listens to messages from a specified Kafka topic. The service demonstrates how to integrate Apache Kafka with Spring Boot, using annotation-based listeners to process incoming messages. The code is organized for clarity and ease of extension, making it suitable for learning or as a foundation for more complex event-driven applications.
